    The Yale School of Art is a <strong>graduate school</strong> that confers MFAs in Graphic Design, Painting/Printmaking, 
    Photography, and Sculpture; and offers undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. 
    Our website exists as an <strong>ongoing collaborative experiment</strong> in digital publishing and information sharing. 
    It functions as a wikiâ€”all members of the School of Art community have the ability to add new, and edit 
    most existing content.
