# BeatIt

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## TO DO NEXT

My vision for what should be was to better define the colors supporting the general dark background, some examples are in the buttons at the top, but more setup is needed to suit them for angular material

I usde angular material mostly because i needed a quick way to implement web structure to show how it can be done, a general top bar that shows any status information relevant to the user (info that should be shown at all times, in most of the websiote pages), a side bar that can be hid for navegation (and web responsiveness), and an aditionnal sidebar for any other pinned information or options to provide the user.

The structure of the code follows a flexible and modular design, even at its basic level, any more complex applications i'd built would built on top of this, for general variables management, different environment and angular.json configurations, and styles in proper folders for each needed part of the styling. Also better implement the media queries for responsiveness

in what design goes, to add some gradient of sorts to the sidebar, or the top bar, define a max width for the central section (generally done because more people use wider screens now) and look for and iomplement better combinations using theory of colors.

The yale website as a whole has its options all over the place, this isn't good for flexibility, some shortcuts could be implemented in the sidebar for general navigation options or customization (since it's an art school, there might be personalization for the website options)

Right side bar could also be done to show errors or other fixed information that can be acted upon. As well as showcase any documentation information.

There are more ideas i can think of when giving UX designs, but this is a general idea to what can be done
